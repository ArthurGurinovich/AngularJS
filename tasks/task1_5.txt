Implement modal-window directive that will take title and actionCallback as params (title is string for window title, actionCallback to handle OK-button click).

You should use ng-transclude directive so that you could insert any content into modal window. Content is context-dependent.

Modal-window dorective use example: 

<modal-window title="modalWindowTitle" action-callback="modalWindowActionHandler(event, sender)">
	<p>
		Although, in a way, the Congressional powers in Article 9 made the "league of states as cohesive and strong as any similar sort of republican confederation in history",
		<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">
			<a ng-click="doSomeMagic()">[11]</a>
		</sup>
		the chief problem with the new government under the Articles of Confederation was, in the words of 
		<a ng-click="doSomeMagic()">George Washington</a>, 
		"no money".
		<sup id="cite_ref-maier11-13_12-0" class="reference"><a ng-click="doSomeMagic()">[12]</a></sup>...	
	</p>
</modal-window>

(There is doSomeMagic handler called in ng-click inside)

Please create doSomeMagic method in rootScope (it doesn't metter what it will do - let it log into console some line - 'Hello World!')
